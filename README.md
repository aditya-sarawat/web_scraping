# web_scraping

This repository includes the web scraping code in python.

Basic Idea: I have created a program in Python to extract useful data from Flipkart about Smart Phones i.e. the Product, its Ratings and its Price. This extracted data is then put in a .csv file to showcase the data in an effective manner. This process of extracting useful data is called as Web Scraping.

Technologies Used:
<br>Python
